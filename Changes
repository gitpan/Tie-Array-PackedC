-Fixed bugs when assigning to an element past the end of the
string. Array was not extended correctly when this happened.

Also added the ->trim method. This prunes the internal representation
of the structure down to used elements only. Any preextension of the
underlying string is thrown away. This can be useful for recovering
unused memory when you know that there will be no more store operations
occuring.
